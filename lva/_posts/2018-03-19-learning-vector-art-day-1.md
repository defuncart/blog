Over the past few years I've become more involved with the art and design process of the apps and games I've been working on. Although I cannot really draw or paint, I've been creating digital artworks for almost 10 years and hold a Masters of Fine Art. One thing I would like to learn is how to draw vector illustrations for games.

The plan is to try and set aside one hour a day, five days a week, to create a simple vector-based art asset. From a technical point of view, I will use a 512x512 canvas so that at the very end it'll be easy to create a short slideshow of the various created art assets.

What I really like about vector graphics is that they are composed of primitive shapes combined together, distorted, subtracted from either other etc. As someone who has never learned to draw, I find this approach logical and understandable. From a practical point of view, they offer device resolution independence and have a much smaller size than raster images.

Chris Hildenbrand has a great series of tutorials where he goes step-by-step through the creation of various assets using primitive shapes. The two guys above are from his [first tutorial](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisHildenbrand/20111015/90415/2D_Game_Art_For_Programmers__Part_1_updated.php) - I imagine for the first month I will stick to his [tutorial website](http://www.2dgameartguru.com/).

Lets see how this practice based series works. I would like to reach 100 posts over the next few months, but for now 25 and 50 are the immediate goals.
