Today I continued with Chris' [first tutorial](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisHildenbrand/20111015/90415/2D_Game_Art_For_Programmers__Part_1_updated.php) and created two simple wheel-based assets. I'm not a huge fan of the car wheel (right) itself, but I think the ship wheel (left) came out pretty good.
