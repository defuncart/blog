Today I continued with Chris' [second tutorial](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisHildenbrand/20111015/90415/2D_Game_Art_For_Programmers__Part_1_updated.php) and created a simple sunrise scene. Although I ran out of time and would have liked to have done more, I'm happy with how it turned out. One thing that I need to start working on is shadows.
