Today I followed two of Chris' tutorials ([here](http://www.2dgameartguru.com/2017/12/slicing-and-dicing-designing-basic-game.html) and [here](http://www.2dgameartguru.com/2013/06/hacking-and-slaying-back-into-action.html)) to create a simple sword and axe respectively. As ever I'm happy with what I achieved within a short period of time but I must soon learn about shading as I believe it'd make a huge difference. Another place I could improve upon are curves.
