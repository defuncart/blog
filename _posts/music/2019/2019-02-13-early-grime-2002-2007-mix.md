Grime is a subgenre of electronic music which draws from a wide variety of influences, for instance UK Garage, Dancehall and Hip Hop. Tracks are generally half-time 140bpm, featuring aggressive electronic sounds and syncopated breakbeats that are often rapped over.

The playlist begins with Know Me, one of the first darker Garage tracks, continuing with two tracks which shaped Grime's initial sound, Eskimo and Pulse X. The following 15 tracks cover Grime's early period from 2002 - 2007, in which it went from being underground, to attaining recognition (Dizzee Rascal won the 2003 Mercury Music Prize) and early success (Oi! and Pow reaching #7 and #11 on the UK Singles Chart).

Mainstream success still eluded the scene, however, with many artist going back underground or altering their sound. Grime began achieving commercial success again in the mid 2010's, culminating in Skepta winning the 2016 Mercury Music Prize and Stormzy becoming the first Grime artist to top the UK album charts.
