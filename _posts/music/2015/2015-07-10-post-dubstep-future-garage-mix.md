From 2009 to 2012 some dubstep producers tried to escape the increasingly brostep defined scene by utilizing house or techno influences, or even returning to that garage sound which originally influenced dubstep. Here is a post dubstep/future garage set featuring tracks of that period. Fond memories of living in SE London then :)
