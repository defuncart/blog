Techstep was a subgenre of drum and bass popular in the late 90s. Characterized by dark synths and sci-fi tones, in its hay-day, Techstep was in fact the leading sound of DnB. The subgenre started to loose traction around the start of the new millennium and later matured into Neofunk. Here is a mix comprising of James’ favorite tracks over the subgenre’s first four and most influential years.
