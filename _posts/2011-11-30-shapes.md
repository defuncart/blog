*Shapes* is my first iOS experiment which facilitates the user with four different shapes corresponding to four different audio instruments. The application is spectral music influenced where the frequency of each audio engine (circle-sine tone, square-square wave, triangle-triangle wave, and diamond-cosine wave) can be explicitly defined.

A new shape can be created from the main menu by simply clicking on the shape (and hence highlighting it) and then pressing ‘create’. The size of this shape can be modified using the pinch gesture (mapped to the instrument’s volume), while the color, red, green, and blue, can be changed using a single tap (mapped to the octave of the frequency). An instrument can be easily removed by double tapping on the shape. Finally the opacity of a shape can be controlled by horizontal placement (vertical placement made no difference), mapped to the cents difference from fundamental frequency.
