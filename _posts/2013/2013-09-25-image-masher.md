Today we are proud to announce the release of *Image Masher!*, a Postdigital art generator and an Image Masher. The application takes four images as inputs, and then conducts effects on pairs of these images, resulting in two new images, which in turn are manipulated to generate a single ‘mashed’ output. This application was used to construct the collection *Election* (2011), and the artwork for Strawberry Complexity‘s debut EP [*This is Pop Music*](https://strawberrycomplexity.bandcamp.com/){:target="_blank"} (2010).

*Image Masher!* was originally written back in 2010, but today has been resurrected and updated for public distribution! Grab your free copy [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q5mgqdmNcBiGyT_wtbsp6GW-0w7DqbNa){:target="_blank"}.

**NOTE:** All images are converted to 500 x 500 pixels before manipulation. Presently the only way to specify another dimension is to edit the patch using [*Max*](https://cycling74.com/products/max/){:target="_blank"}, thus requiring a license. It can, however, be freely ran in its current form using *Max Runtime*.
