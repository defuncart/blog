Today I attended the [*Making Apps that Make Music*](https://www.meetup.com/Making-Apps-That-Make-Music/events/215917022/) meetup at CoUp, Berlin. Up first was producer, techno researcher, and [Liine](https://liine.net/) co-founder Nicolas Bougaïeff who briefly introduced their Lemur app, with special emphasis on the new canvas objects.

Just before the launch of the iPad, I tested out the Lemur hardware at uni, and although it costed over a grand, I wasn’t too impressed. The arrival of the iPad changed everything - a cheap, customizable multi-touch device was finally available, and developers quickly designed MIDI controllers. Although the Lemur app was one of the more prominent options, during my MFA I developed *kontrolr*, my own custom controller for live audiovisual performance.

Up next was Karl who demonstrated the [Axoloti](http://www.axoloti.com/), a powerful microcontroller board which can run custom patches (similar to *Max*, *Pd* and *Reaktor*).
