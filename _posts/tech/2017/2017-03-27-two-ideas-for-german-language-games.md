Today I started to prototype two new ideas for potential German language learning games.

<table style="width:100%" height="20%" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <th><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/2017/17-03-27/01.png" style="width:25% height:50%"></th>
    <th><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/2017/17-03-27/02.png" style="width:25% height:50%"></th>
  </tr>
</table>
<p></p>

Firstly is a *Der Die Das* style game in which the player must drag images into *der*, *die* or *das* containers. Each correct answer turns the draggable-images's background to green, while incorrect is presented with a red background. In either case, the correct answer is spoken to the player and the image fades of the screen after a one second delay.

Secondly is a German Noun Plural test, similar to what I was experimenting with a few years ago, except only multiple choice with no writing.

I'm not too sure if I'll continue working on these as a single game, two separate games or if I'll incorporate these ideas in the German version of Pół na pół (Fünfzig-Fünfzig).
