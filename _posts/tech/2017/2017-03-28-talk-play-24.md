This evening I attended Talk & Play where I had *Pół na pół* available for testing, along with visual mockups of *DerDieDas* and *GermanPlurals*.

*Pół na pół* received positive feedback, especially the minimalistic style and graphics. The timer bar seems to be a complete no go as for most players it wasn't clear what that was and that the game in fact had a time limit.

*DerDieDas* and *GermanPlurals*, although just visual mockups, were positively received also and seem to be ideas worth exploring.
