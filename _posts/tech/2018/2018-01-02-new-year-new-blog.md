After having a research blog from 2011 to 2013 during my MFA (concentrating on live audiovisual performance), and another blog afterwards dedicated to creative coding and custom tools for language learning and audiovisual performance, and another unrelated blog for DeFunc Art's record label, today I am beginning to streamline all these blogs into a new, single Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub.
