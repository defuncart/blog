I am proud to announce that *Caoga caoga*, a fun Irish vocabulary learning game, is now available to download for free on iOS and Android.

One of the first games of its kind for the Irish language, in *Caoga caoga* everyday vocabulary is learned by completing diverse listening, matching and writing exercises, accompanied by descriptive illustrations and native pronunciation.

Developing *Caoga caoga* alone on a $0 budget was a considerable undertaking, however the overwhelming interest and positive feedback show that it was all worthwhile :)
