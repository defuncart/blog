In addition to *Der Die Das*, I've been working on *German Plurals*, a fun German plural noun quiz game in which the player tries to guess the correct plural form for a set of nouns.

- Contains 350 nouns adhering to the Goethe-Institut A1 examination, separated into 7 groups of 50.
- Words are pronounced uses speech synthesis.
- Each correct answer earns one point. A false answer resets the score to zero.
- Progress and difficult nouns can be viewed from a list overview.

Although the game is still in the early prototype stage, I posted discussions to Duolingo and Reddit with a link to an online playable version and asking for feedback. Interest was far lower than with *Der Die Das*, with only 85% less of a response rate. Thus at the moment it make no sense in continuing development of *German Plurals*, instead I will continue solely developing *Der Die Das*, and re-evaluate *German Plurals* once *Der Die Das* has been released for testing on iOS and Android.
