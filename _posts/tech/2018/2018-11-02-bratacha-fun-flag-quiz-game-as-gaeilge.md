Today I uploaded a prototype of *Bratacha*, a fun quiz game, online. Although the idea of *Bratacha* goes back to 2011 (it was, in fact, one of the first native iOS apps I ever developed), today marks the first time I have ever released a playable version online.

As I currently can not work full-time (or even part-time) on a project, *Bratacha* has the perfect small scale to actually develop a simple game while testing out a number of technical components, including, but not limited to:
- IL2CPP, C#6
- Nested Prefabs
- SVG Package
- TextMeshPro
- Android App Bundle
- Google Play Instant Apps

within a live project.

In this very simple prototype, a country's name is displayed in Irish, and the player has to choose the current flag.

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/2018/18-11-02/01.png" style="width:50% height:50%"></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/2018/18-11-02/02.png" style="width:50% height:50%"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p></p>

I've always liked flags, and I enjoy flag quiz games. However, as far as I know, there is no flag quiz game *as Gaeilge*. So I decided that Irish would be the main language of *Bratacha* (which perfectly reflects the app name), with potentially other languages added in the future, for instance English, German, Polish or Russian.

Depending on the feedback I receive, I would like to improve this simple prototype into a full game and release it on the app stores. The main points that I would like to work on are:
- Additional game mode where the player must spell the name of the country.
- Boosters which show the answer or remove two incorrect flags etc.
- Another difficulty setting in which similar flags are displayed (i.e. for Ireland, flags of Italy, Mexico and Ivory Coast could be display along with Ireland's flag).
- Social options: challenge your friends!
- Bonus Levels: Flags of Ireland.
- UI/UX Update.
