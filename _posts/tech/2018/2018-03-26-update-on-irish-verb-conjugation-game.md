I just noticed that Geoglot Apps released *Irish Verb Blitz*, an Irish verb conjugation app last weekend. I haven't tried the game myself, but presently it has only been downloaded about 5 times with no reviews. As they have a series of *Verb Blitz* games, I imagine they decided to release an Irish version as they'd only need to replace the database. The issue with this one-model for all languages approach is that the present conjugations are technically incorrect (*brisim mé* makes no sense, it is either *brisim* or *bris mé*). Also there is no reference to negation or questions (*níor bhris mé*, *ar bhris tú?*).

The game includes four game modes:
1. Infinitive quiz: do you know the meaning of the each verb?
2. Conjugation quiz: can you select the correct verb form for the English translation?
3. Snap quiz: can you spot when the Irish and English sentences match? Try to get ten in a row!
4. Gapfill: can you spell out the missing word in the conjugated sentence?

I honestly haven't heard of GeoGlot before, but they do support an impressive amount of niche languages, including Hungarian, Icelandic, Scottish and Welsh. Although I haven't tried the app, from the above screenshots it doesn't appeal to me as a user, it doesn't seem fun like *Duolingo* or *Caoga caoga*, and displaying the first person singular and plural conjugations as *brisim mé* etc. doesn't make any sense as it will only confuse new language learnings, and warrant negative feedback from those more proficient in the language.

I would like to work on a *Konjugator* mobile game soon, but I imagine it would firstly be German or Russian. Maybe there is a market for a fun Irish verb conjugation game, but after receiving lower than expected downloads for *Caoga caoga*, as a single developer with zero budget, now isn't the time.
