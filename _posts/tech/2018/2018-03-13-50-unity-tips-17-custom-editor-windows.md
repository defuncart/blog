One of the most powerful features of the Unity editor is the ability to create custom windows and inspectors. We have already seen how we can use attributes such as **[Range]**, **[ToolTip]**, **[HideInInspector]**, **[HeaderAttribute]** etc. to customize a component's inspector. However, by writing a custom editor script for a component or asset, we can define exactly how the inspector should look, include useful buttons, visual the data etc.

## Custom Inspector

One very simple but useful addition to an inspector is a button which can display information about the object, import assets from a folder or toggle pre-defined settings. Consider the following *EnemyData* scriptable object.

```C#
using UnityEngine;

/// <summary>An asset used to store data for an enemy.</summary>
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "EnemyData", menuName = "EnemyData", order = 1000)]
public class EnemyData : ScriptableObject
{
  /// <summary>The enemy's health.</summary>
  [Tooltip("The enemy's health.")]
  [Range(0, 100)] public int health;
  /// <summary>The enemy's speed.</summary>
  [Tooltip("The enemy's speed.")]
  [Range(1, 10)] public float speed;

  /// <summary>Returns a string representation of the object.</summary>
  public override string ToString()
  {
    return string.Format("[EnemyData {0}: health={1}, speed={2}]", name, health, speed);
  }
}
```

By default the editor renders the following inspector for this asset:

By writing a script extending from *Editor* and overriding the callback **OnInspectorGUI**, we have complete control over the inspector's layout. These Editor scripts must be placed in the root or a subdirectory of folder named ```Editor```, generally ```Assets/Editor``` but ```Assets/Imported/DeFuncArt/Editor/Utilities/``` would also be valid.

```C#
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;

/// <summary>A custom editor script for the EnemyData asset.</summary>
[CustomEditor(typeof(EnemyData))]
public class EnemyDataEditor : Editor
{
  /// <summary>Callback to draw the inspector.</summary>
  public override void OnInspectorGUI()
  {
    //get a reference to the target script
    EnemyData targetScript = (EnemyData)target;
    //draw default inspector for asset's properties
    DrawDefaultInspector();
    //draw a button which prints info to the console
    if(GUILayout.Button(new GUIContent(text: "Print Info", tooltip: "Prints info about the asset to the console.")))
    {
      Debug.Log(targetScript.ToString());
    }
  }
}
#endif
```

*DrawDefaultInspector* draws the same, default inspector that we saw above. However, underneath we draw a button, which if pressed, prints debug info to the console:

This example may be quite trivial, however you can see the potential, for instance triggering an import method in EnemyData which imports from XLS file, or a LevelManager which imports an array of LevelData assets from a predefined path.

## Custom Window

We can also easily create custom windows in the editor by writing a script extending from *EditorWindow* and customizing **OnGUI**.

```C#
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;

/// <summary>An EditorWindow to automate the creation of game data assets.</summary>
class CustomWindow : EditorWindow
{
  /// <summary>The current selected option.</summary>
  public static int option = 0;
  /// <summary>An array of strings used as toolbar texts.</summary>
  public static string[] optionNames = { "Yes", "No" };

  //add a menu item named "Import Assets" to the Tools menu (shortcut ALT-CMD-B)
  [MenuItem("Tools/Custom Window")]
  public static void ShowWindow()
  {
    //show existing window instance - if one doesn't exist, create one
    EditorWindow.GetWindow(typeof(CustomWindow));
  }

  /// <summary>Draws the window.</summary>
  private void OnGUI()
  {
    //draw a label
    GUILayout.Label("This is my custom window");
    //draw a toolbar (array of buttons) and assign the selected button index as option
    option = GUILayout.Toolbar (option, optionNames);
    //draw a button which, if triggered, prints info to the console
    if(GUILayout.Button("Print Info")) { PrintToConsole(); }
  }

  /// <summary>Prints to console.</summary>
  private void PrintToConsole()
  {
    Debug.Log("Hello, World!");
  }
}
#endif
```
