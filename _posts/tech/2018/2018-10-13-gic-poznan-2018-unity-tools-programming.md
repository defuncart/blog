Today I gave a talk *Unity Tools Programming: Start Improving Your Workflow* at GIC Poznań. The talk, although a general introduction on coding editor tools, was for all Unity users, with code snippets kept to a minimum, and gifs and photos used to visually represent the effects of said code.

> One area of Unity programming that often gets overlooked is the development of tools which help improve the developer’s or the team’s workflow. Well laid-out inspector windows are easier for everyone to use, buttons can easily automate and replace tedious manual assignments, while images in certain folders can be post-processed with additional settings. Learn about these custom tools and more in a talk which will help you start improving your Unity workflow. Future you and your team will thank you!

As this was the first talk that I've given at a gaming conference, I was a little nervous beforehand, especially when a show of hands indicated that 95+% of the attendees were developers. To my relief, no one booed me off the stage, and instead I received a very loud applause at the end, perhaps in no small part to ending with *dziękuję bardzo*! There were many questions too, in fact so many that after the talk a group of developers and I needed to leave the room in order to continue the conversation.

GIC used *Attendify* to allow attendees to rate the talks. From 12 reviews, I received a score of 4/5 which I was very happy with.
