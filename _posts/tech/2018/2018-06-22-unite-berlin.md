Although I wasn't able to attend Unite in Berlin this year, I've been tuning into the livestreams which are now available to watch in full on *YouTube*.

Particular talks that caught my attention were *Unity's Evolving Best Practices*, *TextMesh Pro for Runtime*, *Improved Prefab Workflow* and the keynote in which Unity's roadmap was revealed.
