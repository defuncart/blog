*Quartz Composer* is a node-based visual programming language provided as part of the Xcode development environment in Mac OS X for processing and rendering graphical data. Due to it’s lightweight implementation, and ease of integration into VJ software like [VDMX](http://vidvox.net/){:target="_blank"}, [Resolume](https://resolume.com/){:target="_blank"}, [CoGe](https://imimot.com/cogevj/){:target="_blank"}, and custom tools like [Quartz Composer Performer](http://www.share.dj/share/event_info.php?eventID=345){:target="_blank"}, *QC* has become a staple of the VJing community.

Since I first got interested in VJing this year, I must admit that I’ve never had any desire to look into *QC*. Although it is undoubtedly versatile, there was a lot of speculation that *QC* could be discontinued by Apple with the forthcoming OSX. However, luckily, it seems that *QC* is [still supported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvNeBbEgLdQ){:target="_blank"} on Mavericks, but as no new version has been developed in the last two years, I wonder for how much longer.

Nevertheless, the *QC* community is vast and ever-growing, and not merely limited to live performance. For instance, *QC* and the [*Bangnoise datamosh plugins*](http://kriss.cx/tom/2012/10/08/datamosh.html){:target="_blank"} were used to create a trailer for the recent Superman movie, *Man of Steel*.

Visually I am much more interested in using film than computer generated material, which, within the VJ scene, is what I have invariably seen *QC* used for. Using [*Syphon*](http://syphon.v002.info/){:target="blank"}, one could even connect *QC* into [*VIZZable*](http://vizzable.zeal.co/){:target="_blank"} and *Ableton Live*, so, technically, it would be quite easy to incorporate it within my performance rig. However, one could equally merely use *Lua* scripting for rendering graphics.

Although I realistically don’t see myself learning some *QC*, here, at least, is an introduction by Sergio Mora at a Processing Orlando Meetup for anyone who is interested.

If you’ve any pro/cons of using *QC* or suggestions on alternative approaches, let me know!
