Yesterday we created our own **[+~]** and a simple crossfader in *Gen*. Today we are going to look at more *Gen* operators to build a simple delay object. *Gen* contains Mathematical (**+**, **-**, * etc.), Logical (**!**, **&&**), Comparative (**==**, **>**), and range and routing operators as found in *Max*. Some very useful, but potentially confusing, operators are **clip**, **fold**, **scale**, and **wrap**.

* **scale** works very similar to **[scale]** and **[scale~]** by scaling an input range (i.e. 0, 1) to an output range (i.e. 0, 100). Note there is no clamping!
* **clip** clamps the input between min and max (i.e. 0, 1), so an input of 1.2 would be clamped to 1.0.
* **fold** folds the input between min and max (i.e. 0, 1), so an input of 1.2 would be folded down to 0.8.
* **wrap** wraps the input between min and max (i.e. 0, 1), so an input of 1.2 would be wrapped to 0.2.

To understand these better, play around with the following patch.

*Gen* also contains built in dsp operators such as **cycle**, **buffer**, **pashor** etc. So, using **cycle**, we can create our own sinetone generator.

Operators common to the audio and visual domains can be found [here](https://docs.cycling74.com/max6/dynamic/c74_docs.html#gen_common_operators), and audio only **[gen~]** operators can be found [here](https://docs.cycling74.com/max6/dynamic/c74_docs.html#gen~_operators).

Remember that data in *Gen* is always synchronous, and hence a feedback loop isnâ€™t possible. Thus two very useful operators are **delay** and **history**. **history** is a single-sample delay where any input triggers the output of the previous input. Multiple **history** operators can be daisy-chained to create longer delays, but this is more efficiently achieved using **delay** which delays a signal by a certain amount of time, specified in samples.

Lets create a simple delay patch.

So we create a one-second delay (44100 samples) where the audio folds between [-1, 1]. A feedback is created by mixing this delayed sample with the previous feedback value. A *delayFeedback* **param** controls this from *Max*, with the current feedback value stored in **history** for the next sample. This feedback value is then crossfaded with the original signal, controlled by *delayDryWet* **param**. Notice that both *delayFeedback* and *delayDryWet* are clamped to the range [0, 1] and given initial values.
