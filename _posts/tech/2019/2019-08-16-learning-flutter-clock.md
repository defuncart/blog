A simple clock built using Flutter.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defuncart/learning-flutter/master/clock/screenshots/01.gif)

## Overview

- The app consists of a single screen with three tabs:
    - clock_tab displays an analog clock (package by Furkan Tektas)
    - timer_tab displays a timer (always reset to 1m 10s) which can be started, pause, stopped
    - stopwatch_tab which can also be started, pause, stopped

## Remarks

- Design inspired from iOS Clock app.
- This app uses Swift and Kotlin as the iOS and Android native languages, as opposed to defaults Objective-C and Java. Going forward I think this makes much more sense.
