Over the last couple of days Google's I/O conference has been taking place. 

First thing first, *Flutter for web* has been released as a technical preview. Although only announced last December at *Flutter Live*  under the codename *Hummingbird*, I honestly didn't expect a preview version so soon (for instance Unity's *Project Tiny*, roughly announced around the same time, still doesn't support C#). The ability to create cross-platform apps and a progressive web app from the same code base is delightfully absurd and I cannot wait to try it out. Dart Code already supports Flutter 1.5 and web projects.

Here are all the Flutter related talks from I/O'19:
