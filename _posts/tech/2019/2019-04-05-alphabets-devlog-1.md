Over the last two weeks I've been working towards an alpha release of *αბц*:

- New game mode: transliterating a Georgian word to Latin
- 10 full lessons
- Alphabet flashcard mode where all letters can be scrolled through
- Revision exercise mode where troublesome letters can be revised

  </tr>
</table>

So far I'm very pleased with the app. From a design perspective, I believe the results screen needs an overhaul, while an initial bootstrap would be good to initialize everything while a logo animation is running. An iOS design pass is need to, for instance Progress Bar doesn't look good on iOS compared to Android.
