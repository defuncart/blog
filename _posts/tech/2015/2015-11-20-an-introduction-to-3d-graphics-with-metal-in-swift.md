> Warren Moore, a former Apple engineer, recently stopped by the Swift Language User Group to give an introduction to 3D graphics, Appleâ€™s new Metal framework, and how you can use Metal for 3D rendering from Swift. His presentation covered a lot of ground and was a perfect intro for anybody trying to learn more about 3D, game development, and Swift.
