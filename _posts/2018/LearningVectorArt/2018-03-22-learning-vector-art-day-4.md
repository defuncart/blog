Today I started Chris' [second tutorial](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisHildenbrand/20111019/8692/2D_Game_Art_For_Programmers__Part_2.php) and created a simple underwater scene. I found this more challenging that the separate assets I've been creating the last few days, with it turning out far worse than Chris' effort. Nevertheless I learned about gradients and already look forward to tomorrow's draw time!
