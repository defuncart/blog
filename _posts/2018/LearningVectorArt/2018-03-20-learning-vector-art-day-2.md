Today I continued with Chris' [first tutorial](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisHildenbrand/20111015/90415/2D_Game_Art_For_Programmers__Part_1_updated.php) and created two simple assets which could be used in a platformer game. What surprised me most is how fast one can throw something together than looks decent. I personally think that these these simple vector assets look much better than their currently-fashionable (for indie games and programmers who develop their own art) pixel art equivalents.
