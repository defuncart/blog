#### Background

Last December as part of my #GameInAWeek challenge I created *Pół na pół*, a simple language learning game in which players are given a word and must choose between two images. The concept was inherently simple: I wanted a casual way in which one could refresh vocab in short and concise bursts.

A prototype was written in Swift for iOS and a small, closed early access group was launched in which received feedback was positive. After an extended break in which I started a new job and released a new EP, this prototype has just been re-developed on Unity, thus facilitating both iOS and Android (and even Windows, OSX, Facebook etc.).

#### Multiple Languages or Multiple Apps?

The game was initially Polish-only (hence the name) but as this marketshare is relatively small, I decided to include English, German and Russian as well to get as much feedback as possible.

Should the game support multiple languages or should there be multiple applications each sporting a single language? For the early access phase I will stick with four-languages-in-one but for release, maybe multiple languages would make sense, especially considering the application name and how users could find it on the app stores.

I would, however, like to release a standalone Irish version sometime.

#### Gameplay

The game features levels, each containing words belong to a specific topic, for instance food, numbers, transport etc. There is a limit of 25 words per level so that each level is concise and can be completed in a short period of time. Topics are split between multiple levels, for instance *Animals 1*, *Animals 2* etc.

These levels are then organized into groups of four, followed by a test in which words from all four levels are utilized. Once this test is completed, the player unlocks the next four levels. The player can choose to attempt this test before completing the levels, if they so wish.

#### Game Modes

The game revolves around the 50/50 nature of matching a correct image to a word, with the twist that they must keep their average equal to or above 50%. For the test the player has a specific number of lives and a target set of words.

Throughout the Early Access phase other game modes will be incorporated :)

#### Social Elements

The game will include some simple social elements in which users can challenges their friends to beat their high scores or share power-ups. Once there is a reasonable number of levels to play, some social network integration will commence.

#### Monetization

I honestly do not expect *Pół na pół* to support its own development costs. Depending on the final feature set and feedback in the testing phase, I may explore some monetization options.

#### Timeframe

This game is a one-man job in that I am not only coding the app, but also choosing the topics, writing the translations, taking care of PR/early access and also in charge of the graphics.

I am hoping to devote a day a week to the project but as mentioned above, it is presently hobby-based, and I need to make a living elsewhere.
