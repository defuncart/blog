Stumbled across the [*Algo Rave*](http://algorave.com/about/) website today, and had the somewhat obvious thought of 'algorithmic techno'. Due to techno's repetitive native, surely it muss be quite susceptible to algorithms, well at least more so than some electronic genres like Dubstep and Drum'n'Bass.

Here is some Acid House using a quarter-tone scale.
